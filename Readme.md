### Defining the problem:

**Bike-sharing systems** are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

Repository contains the EDA done on the data of bike-rides in NY for 2011 & 2012. Task is to predict the ride for every 20th of the next month bsaed on various features such as previous rentals, weather, windspeed, time of year etc. Final <b>RMSLE score 0.48968</b>
